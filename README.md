This extension introduces convenient circle menu (so-called pie menu) to improve interaction with your browser. 
Just hold down the right mouse button, highlight one of the preset actions and release it. 

CMG is supposed to provide a better implementation of mouse gestures and drag gestures, while replacing the regular context menu at the same time â€” but regular context menu is always there whenever you need it. Perfect for fullscreen browsing!

Extension features:
- different menus for links, images, input fields etc.
- support for rocker and mouse wheel gestures
- great customization options

Give it a try!
