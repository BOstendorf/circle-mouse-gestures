This extension introduces convenient circle menu (so-called pie menu) to improve interaction with your browser. 
Just hold down the right mouse button, highlight one of the actions and release the button. 

Circle menu recreates the way mouse gestures were represented in good old Opera 12 browser, and allows to clearly see all available gestures, with no need to remember them all.
CMG is supposed to provide a better implementation of mouse gestures and drag gestures, while replacing the regular context menu at the same time â€” but regular context menu is always there whenever you need it. Perfect for fullscreen browsing!

Extension features:
- separate gestures for links, images, input fields etc.
- support for rocker gestures, mouse wheel gestures
- supports horizontal mouse wheel gestures - great on mouses wheel horizontal wheel, such as MX Master
- image preview and link preview (like in Safari on mac)
- vertical and horizontal tab switcher
- gestures on long left click (works great on macbook)
- great customization options
... and many more
