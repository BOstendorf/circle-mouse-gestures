This extension introduces convenient circle menu (so-called pie menu) to improve interaction with your browser. 
Just hold down the right mouse button, highlight one of the preset actions and release it. 

CMG is supposed to provide a better implementation of mouse gestures, while replacing the regular context menu at the same time. 
But whenever you need, feel free to call regular context menu by holding left mouse button and pressing the right one.

Features:
- different menus for links, images, input fields etc.
- support for rocker and mouse wheel gestures
- great customization options

Give it a try!
